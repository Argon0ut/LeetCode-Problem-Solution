DP --> way of making your algorithm efficient by storing some of the intermediate results. It works really well when your
algorithm has a lot of repetitive computations so that you do not have to compute them over and over again.

----------
Steps for solving DP:
1) Visualize Examples
    Directed acyclic graph
2) Find an appropriate subproblem
3) Find relationships among subproblems
4) Generalize the relationships
5) Implement by solving subproblems in order

-----------
For solving DP, there are typically 3 steps you can take:
1) Recursion --> if it contains lots of repetitive computations
|
2) Store (Memoization)
3) Bottom-UP



#DP is like a non-regular languages, because you have to work with previous answers to get the current answer.
