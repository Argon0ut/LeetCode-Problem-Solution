104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
[Easy]
Tree, Binary Tree, DFS
Pattern: DFS with height counting


#Intuition:
This problem's aim is to find the depth of the tree, or in other words the height of the tree
it is essential to know this pattern because it is widely used in other problems too.

# Approach -->
We set a function dfs which gets TreeNode and counter(current height of the element) as arguments
We then iterate through the nodes to get the maximum height comparing it with global variable res

#Complexities:
# Time --> O(n) --> it is visiting each node
# Space --> O(h) --> h is the stack size allocated for recursive calls
