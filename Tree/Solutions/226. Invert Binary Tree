226. Invert Binary Tree
[Easy]
Tree, Binary Tree, DFS
Pattern: DFS with child swapping

#Intuition:
We simply have to start from the top and swap the left and right subtrees

#Approach:
Use recursive DFS and swap the left and right subtrees. The traversal stops when the we hit the leaf node(no children).
The swap can be accomplished either like a, b = b, a or by using a temp variable. In second case it is more space efficient.

#Complexity:
Time O(N)
Space O(H) = O(N) in worst case, O(logN) (best case) if the tree is balanced
where H is the size of the call stack of the recursion.
