#Intuition:
In order to identify weather or not the node is considered good or not, we have to know values of the elements that came
before it. Current node is not good if it is less than the maximum value in our array.

#Approach:
Use pre-order traversal using dfs.
1) res = 0 --> counter of good nodes
2) dfs(current element, array)
    1) stop condition --> return back if the current node is None
    2) check if the current node value is good or not:
        if the array is empty --> good
        val >= max(arr) --> good
        val < max(arr) --> not good
    3) append the current element to the array
    4) check left child
    5) check right child

Generally, pretty easy question.

#Complexities:
Time --> O(n) --> visites
Space --> O(n) --> adding each element to the array (can be optimized if we do no use array but simply track the max values at each step)
