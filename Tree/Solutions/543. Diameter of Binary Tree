543. Diameter of Binary Tree
[Easy]
Tree, Binary Tree, DFS
Pattern: DFS with height computations with simultaneous comparisons
Related: 110. Balanced Binary Tree

# Intuition:
The Diameter is the longest path between any two nodes in the tree.
The path may or may not pass through the root.

We have to perform operations based on the heights of the subtrees

# Approach:
Compute the height of the left subtree
Compute the height of the right subtree
Compare their sub with the maxDiameter
Return the longest between left and right subtrees + 1 (edge to their parent)

# Time Complexity:
O(N)
# Space Complexity:
O(H):
    O(N) --> Worst Case (Skewed Tree)
    O(logN) --> Best Case (Balanced Tree)
