Easy

Intuition: Iterate through the tree using DFS and when the node has no child elements, compare its height to the res.

Approach: dfs with counter. Since reference semantics pass only the Objects directly, the primitive elements are not copied.
so the upper level loop works fine with its current counter

Complexity:
Time: O(n)
Space: O(h) -> h is the height of the tree
