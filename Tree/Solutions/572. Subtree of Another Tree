572. Subtree of Another Tree
[Easy]
Tree, Binary Tree, DFS
Pattern: DFS with Subtrees' Height comparisons
Related:

# AIM:
To check if the one tree contains the other tree

# Intuition:
We simply have to check if the sub tree is in the root tree
Each tree can be represented as an array
We first write the values of subtree into one array and the root string into another array and at the end compare them


# Approach:
Initialize the global return value res = False
Recursive DFS function receives the node and array object as arguments and write down the values
We are using arrays over strings, because strings in python are immutable, and if we pass them as argument and operate on them,
they will only create the copies of those strings inside the function.

We also cannot simply say arr1 in arr2
Thus we first convert the array into strings and then compare them

# Complexity:
Time --> O(n)
Space --> O(n)
