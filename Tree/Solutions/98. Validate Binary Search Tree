Intuition:
Each tree can be represented as an array.
In the case of BST, the array of elements must be in sorted order to be valid.

Approach:
Use DFS to look for every element in the tree by using "Inorder Traversal(L-P-R)"
1) initialize an array that will store all elements
2) traverse using DFS
3) check if the elements in the array are located in increasing order

Complexities:
Time: O(n) --> once traverse through the whole tree and once through array
Space: O(n) --> allocate space in the array for n values
