    106. Construct Binary Tree from Inorder and PostOrder Traversal
}


!!! Important:
Whenever you are given  a traversal order problems, INORDER traversal is mandatory
The first element of PREORDER traversal is the ROOT
Each element in these arrays are unique/distinct


#Intuition
In preorder traversal, we always start from the root.
In other words, the first element in the array constructed by the pre-order traversal, the first element is always the root.
Then we decide which nodes go to right or left subtree using the slicing on the inorder array

#Approach
We use recursive DFS.
1) break condition for recursion -> if preorder or inorder arrays are empty --> return None (meeting the leaf)
2) setting the current element's value as the first element of the preorder array\
3) find the index of that element in the inorder array
4) set the left subtree
    --> pass the preorder array as preorder[1 : mid + 1] and inorder array as inorder[: mid]
        here we do not include the current element into the preorder array and inorder array
5) set the right subtree
    --> pass the preorder array as preorder[mid + 1:] and inorder array as inorder[mid + 1:]
        here we pass the rest of the preorder and inorder.
in 4 and 5, we skip the inorder[mid] from including, because it is already used, and same for preorder[0]
Important --> the length of the preorder and inorder lists are equal


#Complexities:
Time: O(n) --> visiting each node
Space: O(n) --> creating nodes for each element
n = number of nodes
