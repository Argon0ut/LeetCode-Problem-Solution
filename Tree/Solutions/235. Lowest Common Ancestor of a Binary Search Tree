# Definition:
Lowest Common Ancestor(LCA) :
“The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in Tree
that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

# Intuition:
We simply have to track the elements that come to be the children of certain parent.
We can use a hashtable to store the sets of elements that are children of a certain parent.

# Approach:
We need an array that will store the ancestors and the hashTable with treeNode : set() pairs.
1) track the parent
2) track the left child and append join the corresponding set with the parent's set
3) same procedure for the right child
4) track the elem if it contains both required Nodes.

return the first element in the res array

# Complexities:
Time:
Worst Case --> O(n^2) --> Skewed Tree --> Copying the sets of the same length
Avg Case --> O(N*logN) --> Balanced Tree

Space --> O(n^2)
First root stores n values
next stores n - 1
next stores n - 2 and so on.
the total size of sets is: n + n - 1 + n + 2 + ... + 1 = O(n^2)
