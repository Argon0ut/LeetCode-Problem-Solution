199. Binary Tree Right Side View
Medium

Intuition:
This problem is very similar to 102. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal.
In this problem we have to find the right most element in each level, while in 102, we had to find each element in at each level.

Approach:
We have to simply store all the elements at current level into Hash Table with
level: List(int)

At the end put all the last elements of each level into array.

Complexities:
Time --> O(n) --> we visit each node of the tree
Space --> O(n) --> we allocate space for 1 node at each level
