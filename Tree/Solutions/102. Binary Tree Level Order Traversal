102. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
[Medium]

This is a very interesting problem that can be solved both via DFS and BFS

My approach focuses on the DFS approach

Intuition:
1) the output is fully based on the height of the Binary Tree. That is why we can use/change the algorithm used for
finding the height of the binary tree

Application:
1) We need a HashTable that will store all the elements by level, and the key:value pair will look as follows:
    Level(int) : elements(List[int])

2) Use DFS to Visit each node
The traversal is proceeded via pre-order traversal(PLR).
We first create a K:V pair in HashTable or add to existing one, then do the same for children

The HashTable in python is not ordered in its nature. But in our case, the levels are already added in sorted order,
so no need to worry about the ordering.

At the end, simply initialize the final array and add all elements of the HashTable via generator


Complexity:
Time --> O(n) --> running through all elements of the tree
Space --> O(n) --> store all elements into hashtable
