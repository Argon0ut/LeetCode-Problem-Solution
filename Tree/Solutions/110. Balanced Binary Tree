Pattern: DFS with Subtrees' Height comparisons
Related: 543. Diameter of Binary Tree

# Definition:
A height-balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.

# Intuition::
We simply have to find the height of the subtree and compare it to the height of the opposite subtree.
If their absolute difference is more than 1, the tree is not balances.

#Approach:
Open a global variable to return --> res = True
Write dfs that returns the height of max height of the subtree.
Check condition for validation is abs(left - right) <= 1
The traversal does not stop when one of subtrees is null, which means that it can go through entire skewed tree.

Complexity:
Time O(N)
Space O(H):
Worst Case: O(N) --> Skewed Tree
Best Case: O(logN) --> Balanced Tree
