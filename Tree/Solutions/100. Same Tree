Pattern: Iterating two trees at the same time

# AIM:
the aim here is to practice the iteration of two trees at the same time

# Intuition:
Simply iterate through each node in both trees at the same time

# Approach:
Use dfs to traverse both trees
There are several edge cases to handle: one subtree is None, both are None, both present.

# Complexity:
    # Time Complexity:
        O(n)
    # Space Complexity:
        O(n)
